        The Bible tells us that the chaos and pain in our world today are the
        direct result of our rejection of God's authority and glory.<sup>2</sup>
        To reject His authority and glory is the greatest sin of all. Because of
        this, we all stand guilty and must face the consequences of God's eternal
        judgment.<sup>3</sup>

            Jesus came to this world as a baby to restore the true beauty and
            glory of life as God had designed it. By living in perfect and
            humble obedience to God the Father, the unique Son of God came with
            a purpose: "to save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

            The cradle led to the cross, where the God-Man, Jesus Christ, bore

            The cross led to the crown. Death could not hold Jesus. Having paid
            the price for our sin, the sinless Son of God rose from the dead. He
            now has the power to graciously forgive our sins and reconcile us to
            the eternal God of glory.<sup>5</sup>
